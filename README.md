# Zoho's Evolution in India


Zoho Corporation's journey from a small Chennai apartment in 1996 to becoming India's second-largest SaaS company represents one of the most remarkable success stories in Indian technology. With ₹8,703 crores ($1.4 billion) in global revenue and 15% contribution from India alone, Zoho has established itself as a formidable competitor to global giants like Salesforce and Microsoft.
